# ETL-Project

I built a data etl script that fetched a csv file from a remote server and unzipped it. The unzipped file then cleaned of bad data based on specifications provided, multiple reports were then generated from the file. This script utilized bash, sed, and awk to accomplish the desired outcomes.

Note: this script attempts to SCP to a remote server and requires the servername, userid, and full path to file, to run correctly.
